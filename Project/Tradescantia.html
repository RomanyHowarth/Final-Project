        <p>The Tradescantia (also known as Spiderworts) are beautiful, resilient, and convenient plants. They are trailing plants that can grow very fast and can be quickly revived after being pushed to the brink of desolation. There are many varieties of Tradescantia and these instructions will be for Tradescantia Zebrina plant!</p>

        <div><h2>Top Tips:</h2></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Try not to move your plant around too much. They tend to adapt quickly to a spot but moving them to different areas frequently can stump growth while they adapt.</li>
                <li>Water frequently when the top inch of soil is dry</li>
                <li>These plants are incredibly easy to propagate! Once it starts to get long simply chop off the top and either plant it right back in the soil or put in water until roots grow. You'll have a whole new plant! </li>

        <h6>Humidity</h6>
