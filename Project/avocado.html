        <p>Avocados are native to central America, so need plenty of warmth, sunshine and moisture. You can grow an avocado plant from the seed surprisingly easily, although it is unlikely that you will manage to get any fruit from it unless you are in a warm climate!</p>

    <div class="section1">
        <div><h2>How to grow</h2></div>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove and clean pip, making sure to wash off all of the fruit and leaving the brown skin on.</li>
                <li>Locate which end is "up" and which is "down". Some pits are longer or almond shaped while some are spheres, but all of them have a bottom and top. The pointer end is the top and the flat end is the bottom. You need to place the bottom end in the water so that the roots can grow.</li>
                <li>Pierce with three toothpicks. Stick them at a slight downward angle, spaced evenly around the circumference of the avocado. These are your scaffolding and will allow you to balance the seed on a glass with half of it in the water. </li>
                <li>Place the seed in a glass with the bottom half submerged in water.</li>
                <li>Change the water every 3-5 days</li>
                <li>Wait for it to sprout! This can take anywhere between 2-8 weeks so be patient!</li>
                <li>Pot in soil when the tree is about 15cm tall</li>
            </ol>

        <h5>Care</h5>
        <p>Once your avocado has grown to around 15cm you can plant it in soil. As they are native to central America, they can have particular caring needs when grown in colder climates such as in the UK</p>
        <ul>Sunlight: Avocado plants LOVE full sun so  make sure to keep them in a sunny spot! In the summer you can put them outside so they can soak in the full sun but make sure and bring them back inside in the evening or it will get too cold for them (especially in UK temperatures!)</ul>
        <ul>Water: Once in soil your avocado will like to be completely dried out before watered. Water sparingly, perhaps every few days. You could get a moisture meter to check the soil wetness to prevent overwatering. Make sure to plant in a pot with drainage holes as the roots get very long and will rot if they are sat in water at the bottom of the pot</ul>
        <ul>Repotting: You can tell when your plant needs repotting when the roots begin to grow out of the drainage holes in it's current pot. This will encourage growth.</ul>
