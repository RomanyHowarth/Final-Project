        <p>The word 'cactus' comes from Latin through Ancient Greek with the plural being either 'cacti' or 'cactus'. A member of the Cactaceae plant family, a cactus is a prickly plant accustomed to desert conditions. They are easy to care for and extremely hardy, so are the perfect beginner plant for those without plant care skills! </p>

        <div><h2>Top Tips:</h2></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Handle with care! Most houseplant cacti have spikes so be sure to handle them carefully and keep them away from children and pets!</li>
                <li>There is a myth that they do not need water, they do! </li>
                <li>They can grow fast if you make sure to repot them in bigger pots as they grow</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Sunlight</h3>
        <h4>Cacti love the sun so a bright, sunny spot is perfect for them! Leaving them in the shade can result in discolouration and limited growth. Keeping them on a sunny south-facing windowsill is a good spot but too much strong sun can result in burning.</h4>
        <div id="lightSymptoms">
            <h4>Too much light:</h4>
            <p>Most cacti can handle direct sun but too much can be harmful for some, especially those that are not used to it. For example, if you were to move a cactus into the sun after it has gotten accustomed to the shade it may burn!<br><br>These can be symptoms of too much light:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browned or calloused flesh with a rougher texture than the rest of the plant</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Not enough light:</h4>
            <p>While some species can tolerate lower light levels, no cactus tends to thrive in the dark with these being some symptoms of light deprivation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Discolouration - the deep green can turn to a pale green</li>
                <li>Unusual growth habits - Cacti will stretch to reach the light and have new strange growths which are much smaller than the rest of the plant like a skinny branch. </li>
                <li>Root rot - lack of sunlight can result in the soil staying moist for too long and rotting the roots. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="section3">
        <h5>Water</h5>
        <p>There is a misconception that cacti do not need to be watered, but in fact they definitely do and thrive when watered correctly! <br><br> Cacti thrive best when they are watered thoroughly, and then left until the soil/ potting media is completely dried out before watering again. However, this is usually not often. Excluding winter months, cacti usually only need to be watered every 3-4 weeks. During the winter they do not need to be watered at all!</p>
        <div id="waterSymptoms">
            <h4>Too much water:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mushy feeling</li>
                <li>Browning or blackening of flesh, stem, or at the base of the plant</li>
                <li>Rotting - brown or black roots suggest root rot from too much water. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Not enough water:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Puckering or shriveling of flesh</li>
                <li>Discolouration- turning brown, dry, and/or calloused</li>

            </ul>

    <div class="section4">
        <h6>Humidity</h6>
        <p>The relative humidity for cacti plant is between 40-60%. Anything below 40% is too dry for most cacti, although some desert species may be okay. You can use a hygrometer to measure the humidity in your house. You can also mist your cacti if it struggling with low humidity. <br><br> The higher the temperature and smaller amount of vapour in the air, the lower the humidity and vice versa.</p>
        <div id="humiditySymptoms">
            <h4>Humidity too high:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mold on the plant's stem</li>
                <li>Rotting of stem</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Humidity too low:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Discolouration- cactus turning yellow</li>
                <li>Withering or death of any flowers</li>
            </ul>
